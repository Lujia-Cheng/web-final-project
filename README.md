Activity 8
=================
In this activity you are going to write a simple REST API that performs some basic operations, given a dictionary of words (in JSON format). Your API should perform the following functions:

* GET dictionary/:word - retrieves the definition of a given word
* POST dictionary/ - creates a new definition in the dictionary (this should be faked out)
* DELETE dictionary/:word - deletes the word in the dictionary, if it exists (this is also faked out)

server.js - this is where your project is initialized and your Node app starts.
